# Graph Coloring Visualization Tool

## Overview
This project is a Python-based tool for visualizing graph coloring algorithms. It provides an interactive GUI to generate graphs, load graphs from files, save graphs, and visualize graph coloring using different algorithms. The tool supports greedy coloring by node order, greedy coloring by highest degree, and backtracking algorithms.

## Features
- **Graph Generation:** Generate random graphs with customizable density.
- **Load/Save Graphs:** Load graphs from JSON files or save generated graphs.
- **Visualization:** Visualize the graph coloring process step-by-step.
- **Algorithms:**
  - Greedy Coloring by Node Order
  - Greedy Coloring by Highest Degree
  - Backtracking Coloring

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - `networkx`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `tkinter`
  - `numpy`
